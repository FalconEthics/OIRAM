[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://OIRAM-falconethics.vercel.app/)

In this wacky adventure, you'll play as OIRAM, a mustached hero on a mission to save the princess from the clutches of an evil mushroom king. But don't worry, this game is not your average Mario clone. We've added plenty of surprises to keep you on your toes, like power-ups that turn you into a giant mushroom, and enemies that break into a dance when you defeat them.

So what are you waiting for? Give OIRAM a try and see if you have what it takes to rescue the princess and defeat the evil mushroom king. But beware, this game is highly addictive and may cause extreme laughter and joy.

### Built With

It is built using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding.I've put in a ton of effort to create a seamless gaming experience, from the charming graphics to the catchy soundtrack. And don't forget about the hilarious sound effects - you'll be chuckling as you jump and run your way through the levels. While it's true that there are many better ways to create this kind of experience but as it was actually a college project i had to use the given tech stack.
